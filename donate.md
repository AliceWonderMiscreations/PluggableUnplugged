Donations
=========

Last year I almost became homeless.

That may happen again this year, and my safety net is gone.

I am autistic with social problems and epilepsy, makes employment very
difficult to maintain.

If you benefit from this plugin and you have the financial means, please
donate.

I also maintain the [LibreLAMP.com](https://librelamp.com/) LAMP stack for
CentOS 7 and the [Media.LibreLAMP.com](https://media.librelamp.com/) media
stack for CentOS 7.

Donations can be sent to paypal@domblogger.net

I can not accept bitcoin at this time because to save money, I am on severely
limited bandwidth and the blockchain, well, it uses a lot of bandwidth.

Thank you.

More privacy plugins are planned, it disgusts me how many WordPress sites sell
their users out.
